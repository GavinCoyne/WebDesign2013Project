        <h1>1.0 Web Page Development for Non-profit Organization or Small Businesses</h1><br />

           <strong> 1.1 </strong>  Purpose /Objective </br>

            <p>Be able to develop your web design skills with an actual organization.  The contacts
                that you make with clients when you demonstrate your web presence prototype will
                be very rewarding. You will be designing something that you can present to a company
                and you will have fun in the challenge that this will create.  You will learn how
                to do pre-sales consulting by creating a demo to show to a potential client.
                This is also good practice for interviewing skills.  Ultimately, you will practice
                your professionalism in handling the relationship and the rewards will be great.
                Additionally, this would provide networking contacts with local businesses
                and communities.
                </p> <br />
           <strong>1.2</strong> Why a Web-based project?<br /><br />

            <p>You can learn programming and Information Technology by working on just about any kind of project
            - computer games, scientific, accounting and other applications. We think a good learning project
            should be fun, useful and real. It should be something you'll be proud
            to show to potential employers. It should demonstrate your technical mastery,
            creativity and overall understanding of the software development process.</p><br />

             <span>The Web was picked as the context for most of your learning project because:</span><br />

            <ul>
                <li>TThe Web is hot!  It's everywhere. It's hitting every institution and organization like a tidal wave. It will define the way we live for the next century just as the internal combustion engine has defined how people lived in this century. Best of all, you can still get in on this technology at the ground floor and that is exciting!</li>
                <li>The Web is cool!  You can do lots of cool things on the Web. Your imagination and persistence are the only limits! This technology is literally changing by the hour. You can build Webs with today's tools that previous classes could not even imagine -- pictures, sound, motion, transactions, etc... Now, that's cool!</li>
                <li>The Web is green  ($$$)!  There are thousands of jobs for Intranet and Internet developers. Don't take our word for it. Check out sites like www.occ.com for yourself (use a search term like "HTML" or "Internet"). Proficiency in Web development is your ace card to a hot job. This project is your best chance to learn how to do it.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>1.4</strong>   Before We Begin

<span>There are some critical factors for success.  They include</span><br />
<ul>
    <li>A positive attitude about learning by doing. This is the single most important factor. If you believe that you can learn web design like you learn History (i.e., by listening to someone talk or by reading a book, then you will likely FAIL). Remember that the best way to learn web design is by DOING it.</li>
    <li>Willingness to explore, especially into cyberspace. Just about everything you need to create a successful product can be found on the web. There are examples you can reference, XHTML codes you can copy, graphics you can download and more. If you're not motivated to explore, you'll only turn out a mediocre product.</li>
    <li>Hard work. Last but not least, you need to work hard, and you need to work smart. Web Design professionals are not workaholics, but they are good time managers.</li>
</ul>

<strong>1.5</strong>   Setting the Scene<br /><br />

<p>Just about every organization or business could use a web presence.  Companies use
    the web to promote their products and services.  Non-profit organizations use
    the web to promote their causes.  Communities use the web to attract investment to their
    region.  Professionals such as lawyers and consultants use the web to promote their expertise.
    Schools and universities use the web to recruit students.  The possibilities are endless.
</p><br />

</ol>

<strong>1.7 </strong>  Monitoring Your Progress <br />
<p>Your Project Plan should always be front and center – keep a copy displayed somewhere where you can constantly monitor and review.  The effectiveness of your Plan will determine the proficiency and success of your web application.
A warning about a common planning pitfall is that in software application development, minor tasks may require extensions in deadlines.  Over the course of your project work, those delays in deadlines can turn into serious time problems.  Monitor your progress frequently to prevent this from happening.  You should identify where and how you will make up for even those minor deadline extensions, as this web project has a zero extension of submission deadline.

        <strong>2.8.2</strong>  Web Presence Style Guidelines for deliverables        <br />

        Introduction
        The purpose of this document is to give you the expected minimum style and appearance for your documentation in H/XTML format. The details included here are to assist you in the presentation of a professional documentation in H/XTML.  While there is no standard form for documentation, these guidelines will assist you in presenting your material in the best possible format.

        Fonts
        A serif font, Tahoma, size 10 point should be used for all body text, headings and diagrams. Do not combine bold and underline font attributes on the same piece of text.

        Tables
        In general, tables should use the same page space as the body of the document. Shading of the heading row is not required but, if used, should not exceed 10% shading. More shading than that and the text within become difficult to read upon reproduction. The text in the heading row should be bolded and centered. The data in the remaining rows can be centered or left justified.  Do not use tables for a complete page layout; preference would be to use CSS.
        A sample table is below:

        Product	Product Number	Manufacturer
        LaserJet 5N printer	165-6548-8454-645	Hewlett – Packard
        Microsoft FrontPage 2010	548-88-7744-5452	Microsoft

        Abbreviations
        For abbreviations or acronyms, use the full version of the word the first time with the abbreviation or acronym in brackets.  Every following occurrence, use the abbreviation or acronym. For example, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the basic language of web design and development.

       <p> Bibliography
        A complete bibliography MUST be used for all references used in the documentation.  Failure to provide a complete bibliography would result in a FAIL grade of the project, as well as, academic dishonesty (Refer to course outline on TRU policy on academic honesty).
        The recommended format is:
        Author's Name, Title of Book. Publisher, Location of Publication, Publication Date. ISBN
        Bolles, Richard Nelson, What Color is Your Parachute ? Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, California, 1996. ISBN 123-324-5556-6666
        Resources other than books may be identified. These include magazines, and Web sites. The format to follow for these is below:
        Magazine	Author's name, "Article name," Magazine Title (Date): page numbers.
